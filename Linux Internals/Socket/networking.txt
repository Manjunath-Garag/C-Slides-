Scokets:
are used connect between 2 Processess in the Netowrking Field.
Computer can act as a Process and the Server is also a Process.
Socket is an end point of 2-way Communiction

www.google.com	 How is it converted to IP address.??
With help of DNS Domain name server.
DNS is Nothing but a Phone book Stores the Names of the Domains and Converts it to IP ADDRESS. 

How will www.google.com Communicate with DNS??
With help of ISP INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER.
ISP Provides access to the Internet
Ex:Airtel, Vodafone, JIO.

How do we Block a Particular site in Network??
Just Remove the name from the DNS, and it will be IMpossible to access that Particluar Website.

Now that we got the IP ADDRESS from the DNS server How do we reach to that IP??
That is done with help of Routers.

Ex:: COnsider that a Process has to Communicate with the Server. It is only Possible with the help of ROUTERS.
Each Router has has a IP Table. there will be N-no of routers, thought which it has to go and reach the Server.
each Router will Provide the Direction towards the Particular IP.
The Table consists of the INFOMATION OF To the direction to the Particular SERVER(IP-address)
INTERNET :: It is collection of Routers.

TCP/IP MODEL
-----------------
______Application Layer		:: This the palce where all the Applications Run (or placed) CHROME, PINBALL, TORRENTS
Consider a Hello msg has to sent to Another Process in another PC.
It has go through the Transport Layer.

______Transport Layer	 	:: THis layer will attch the Sender and Receiver Ports to the msg "HELLO"
like	
receiver port, MSG, sender port
4000,HELLO,6000
This will sent to the Network Layer.

______Network Layer		:: In the network layer It will attach the IP-address of the Particular Device to which data has to sent.
receiver IP, recevier PORT, msg, sender Port, sender IP
Receiver-IP,4000,HELLO,6000, Sender-IP

_____Physical Layer		:: This layer will attch the MAC addrress to the ONLY THE SENDER MAC ADDRESS.
MAC, receiver IP, recevier PORT, msg, sender Port, sender IP
MAC, Receiver-IP,4000,HELLO,6000, Sender-IP
THIS above address will accepted by all the PC in the Network and Later In the network layer The Particular RECEIVER-IP is CHECKED and if it Matches with the IP 
then That Packet is received else it would be Discared.


How will the Transport layer get to Know to which Layer it has to Tranfer the Data ??
Ans:: Port NUmber.
Every Process (Service) has it own Port Number.

Transport Layer Helps to send DATA to Particluar SERVICE (with the help of PORT NUMBER).
